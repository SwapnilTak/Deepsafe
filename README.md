# RJPOLICE_HACK_497_BLAZE_8

The deep fake detection project makes use of a number of methods, such as two-stream networks,
generative adversarial networks, metadata analysis, and 3D face recognition. Python is the most
popular programming language because of its adaptability and fit for deep learning and computer
vision applications. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are used in front-end development to facilitate user
interaction. For efficiency and scalability, the backend uses Node.js, while the database management
system is SQL. TensorFlow and PyTorch use pre-trained models to improve deep fake detection. By
employing adversarial networks to train a two-stream network to distinguish between actual and
fraudulent films, the study seeks to increase accuracy. In order to properly detect deepfakes, the
two-stream network technique looks at both temporal and spatial factors, finding motion patterns
and visual cues.
